# Rust core

[한국어](plan.ko.md)

http-cookie reads the cookies of a request and writes the field value of a `Set-Cookie` field line by the rules of
[the specification](../../spec/cookies.md). Every rule is written once, in the Rust crate `polyspec-http-cookie` of
`packages/rust`, and tested once, by the cases of `contracts/cookies.json`. The packages of PHP, Python, Node, the
browser (WASM) and Go hold no code of their own: binding generates each of them from the interface contract
`packages/rust/interface.json`, and binding scaffold writes their binding crates.

The core, the interface contract, the workspace of the binding crates and the tests of the five targets are in the
tree; [the checklist](checklist.md) holds what the first release still needs, in the order in which each step needs
the one before it:

1. The checks of the documents and of the tracked files (T1.1, T1.2).
2. The dependency on binding by its released tag in place of its branch (T1.3), which waits for the release of binding
   0.0.2.
3. The packages of the bindings per platform (T1.4): binding generates their release recipes, so this repository
   writes none of its own, and kit 0.0.111 packs their kinds.
4. The first release (T1.5): every job of `ci.yml` passes on `main`, and the tags of the core and of the Go module are
   set.
